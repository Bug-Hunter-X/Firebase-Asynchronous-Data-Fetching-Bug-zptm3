# Firebase Asynchronous Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching methods. The issue arises from attempting to access fetched data outside the scope of the asynchronous callback, which can result in undefined values.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles asynchronous operations properly.

## Problem

The `bug.js` example attempts to process data fetched from Firebase before the asynchronous operation completes. This leads to the `data` variable being undefined, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous Firebase operations.  The data processing is contained within the callback function, ensuring that the data is available before it's used.
